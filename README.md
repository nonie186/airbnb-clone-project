# Role Documentation:
Understand and articulate the responsibilities of various team members, fostering collaboration in real-world scenarios.

**Business analyst (BA)**

Understands the customer’s business processes
Translates customer business needs into requirements
A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client formulate what their wants look like and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements.

**Product owner (PO)**

Holds responsibility for a product vision and evolution
Makes sure the final product meets customer requirements
Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog. Associated mainly with flexible Agile environments, a product owner is particularly useful in scenarios where requirements and workflows frequently change.

**Project manager (PM)**

Makes sure a product or its part is delivered on time and within budget
Manages and motivates the software development team
In sequential models, a project manager is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities, and updating project status.
In Agile projects where the focus is on self-management, transparency, and shared ownership, a PM sets up the vision of a product, maintains transparency, fosters communication, searches for improvements in the development process, and makes sure a team delivers more value with each iteration.

**UI/UX designer**

Transforms a product vision into user-friendly designs
Creates user journeys for the best user experience and highest conversion rates
There are two aspects to the product design process—user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design.
A UI designer devises intuitive, easy-to-use, and eye-pleasing interfaces for a product, while the UX part stands for thinking out an entire journey of a user’s interaction with a product. A UX designer is thus involved in such activities as user research, persona development, information architecture design, wireframing, prototyping, and more.


**Software architect**

Designs a high-level software architecture
Selects appropriate tools and platforms to implement the product vision
Sets up code quality standards and performs code reviews
An architect is an expert-level software engineer who makes executive software design decisions on behalf of an app development team. You will need one if you deal with a software product with complex requirements or legacy software that calls for profound changes. A software architect decides which services and databases should communicate together, how integrations should work, and how to ensure that the product is secure and stable.

**Software developer**

Engineers and stabilizes the product
Solves any technical problems emerging during the development lifecycle
A software developer does the actual job and codes an application. And just like an app features a front end and a back end, there are front-end and back-end developers.
Front-end developers create the part of an application that users interact with, ensuring that an app offers an equally smooth experience to all—no matter the device, platform, or operational system.
Back-end developers, in turn, implement the core of an app—its algorithms and business logic. Experienced back-end developers not only write code but also do the tasks of an architect—for example, devise an app architecture or design and implement the necessary integrations.

**Quality assurance (QA) engineer**

Makes sure an application performs according to requirements
Spots functional and non-functional defects
The job of a quality assurance engineer is to verify whether an application meets the requirements—both functional and non-functional. Functional requirements define what an application should do, while non-functional requirements specify how it should do that. To verify both, QA specialists run various checks, followed by analyzing the test results and reporting on the application quality.
They evaluate an application from different angles—be it functionality, usability, security, or performance (hence, many types of testing). To keep track of the executed checks and ensure that all the requirements are covered with tests, QA specialists may create different kinds of testing documentation—from test scenarios to test protocols to test results reports. And experienced QA engineers design and implement quality assurance processes and procedures that help prevent defects at later stages of development.

**Test automation engineer**

Designs a test automation ecosystem
Writes and maintains test scripts for automated testing
A test automation engineer is there to help you test faster and better. To enable that, they develop test automation scripts—small programs that provide reliable and continuous feedback on application quality without any human involvement.
A skilled test automation engineer would help you choose which parts of an application are suitable candidates for automation and what’s better to be tested manually. They would also design a test automation ecosystem that is easy to maintain and update. Finally, they’ll make sure that your test automation initiative generates as much value as possible at a reasonable cost.

**DevOps engineer**

Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams
Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery
Even in Agile environments, development and operations teams can be siloed. DevOps engineers serve as a link between the two teams, unifying and automating the software delivery process and helping strike a balance between introducing changes quickly and keeping an application stable. Working together with software developers, system administrators, and operational staff, DevOps engineers oversee and facilitate code releases on a CI/CD basis.

# Technology Stack Breakdown:
Explore the technologies used in a scalable project and their specific contributions to achieving project goals.

# Database Design Proficiency:
Plan and document a relational database structure with entities, attributes, and relationships that mirror real-world requirements.

# Feature-Driven Development:
Identify and describe core features of the application, focusing on their relevance to the user experience and business logic.

# API Security Fundamentals:
Implement and document key security measures to safeguard application data and ensure secure transactions.

# CI/CD Pipeline Integration:
Gain insights into setting up automated development pipelines, boosting efficiency and minimizing errors during the deployment phase.

This structured approach ensures learners not only build technical skills but also adopt a mindset geared toward problem-solving, scalability, and industry-grade project execution.
